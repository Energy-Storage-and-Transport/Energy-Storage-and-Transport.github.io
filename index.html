    <h3 id="background">The energy transition: an engineering challenge</h3>
    <p>
    In 2015, all members of the United Nations agreed on an <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/">Agenda for Sustainable Development</a>, aimed at transforming the world by 2030. At the core of this agenda are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

    <p>
    In order to achieve these goals, fundamental changes in our energy system are required. The process of changing our energy system is referred to as the <em>energy transition</em>. Technological innovations across a wide range of disciplines are required to make our energy system sustainable.
    </p>

    <p>
    The energy transition poses tremendous challenges for engineers, both from a technological perspective and from the vantage point of sustainability. As an engineer of the future, you are expected to develop technology to enable the energy transition, while simultaneously taking into consideration the effects that this technology has on our lives.

    <p>
    A major technological challenge in the energy transition is to accommodate our energy system to deal with the more fluctuating nature of green energy sources compared to conventional (fossil fuel based) energy sources. Where conventional energy can be fully controlled, green energy depends on external factors over which we have limited control. In the current energy system, where the majority of energy still comes from fossil fuels, the fluctuations in green energy production are leveled out by conventional energy production.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the western world, energy exchange markets (for example <a href="https://www.epexspot.com/">EPEX SPOT</a> in The Netherlands) regulate the supply and demand of energy. To improve the economic competitiveness of green energy sources on these markets, it is essential to make them less dependent on balancing by conventional energy sources. The ability to efficiently store green energy in situations when there is a surplus of production (for example, at night) and to deliver this stored energy when there is a surplus of demand (for example, during the day), is key to making green energy competitive. Currently, the storage capacity on the energy grid is limited. The development of innovative energy storage and transport technologies is essential to make green energy economically viable, and, thereby, to enable the energy transition.
    </p>

    <p>

   In this project we make the distinction between two types of energy storage and transport systems:
   <ul>
   <li>
      A <em>grid energy storage system</em> typically is a large-scale storage system connected to the electrical grid. Energy is collected in the grid energy storage system at times when there is plenty of (inexpensive) electrical energy, for example, during windy periods. This energy is then released to the electrical grid at times when there is a shortage of generated electricity. The connection to the electrical grid makes that these storage systems are operated within the regulations of the electrical energy exchange market.
    </li>
    <li>
      In <em>energy recovery and recycling systems</em> a surplus of energy (thermal, electrical, chemical, etc.) at one moment is temporarily stored in order to be released at times of shortage, and/or the surplus is transported to a location where it can be made to good use. Such storage systems can vary from small-scale to large-scale applications, also with a significant variation in storage times. Energy recovery and recycling systems are often not operated on an exchange market, but are instead used as a peer-to-peer energy exchange system.
    </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="projectgoals">Project goals</h3>
    <p>The overarching goal of this project is defined as:</p>
    <div class="block projectgoals">
      <p>
      <b>
       To develop a mathematical-physical model for an energy storage and transport system, and to validate this model using experiments. Within the framework of challenge-based learning, the project groups independently define their own energy storage and transport solution.
      </b>
      </p>

    </div>

    <p>In the process of accomplishing this overarching objective, the following learning goals will be achieved:</p>

    <div class="block learninggoals">
    <p>In this project you will learn to...</p>
    <ol>
      <li> ...define an energy transport and storage system with time-dependent behavior. The complexity of the system should be in line with the competence level expected from a second year engineering student, and should take into account the strengths and weaknesses of your project group.</li>
      <li>...apply a predefined modeling cycle when developing and validating a model. In the early stages of the project, your group should be able to identify the key components and possible bottlenecks in the various modeling phases and to establish a time line for the modeling process.</li>
      <li>
      ...apply known mathematical-physical concepts to model the time-dependent behavior of the selected system. Your group should be able to identify key components of the system and describe at least one of these components by a differential equation.</li>
      <li>...reflect on the validity of the model, and to develop a plan to experimentally validate a crucial, time-dependent, component of the system.</li>
      <li>...design and build an experimental set-up, in order to validate the identified critical, time-dependent, component of the system. In designing the experiment, your group should focus on reproducibility and accuracy.</li>
      <li>...perform experiments and process and analyze experimental data following good statistical practice. Your group should be able to draw conclusions regarding the validity of the model, and to propose model and experiment improvements based on the processed data.</li>
      <li>...draw conclusions and make recommendations regarding the applicability and economic viability of the considered energy transport and storage system in the real-world setting, making use of the validated model.
      </li>

    <p>To train you for performing the experimental validation, as part of this project, a measurement training is provided. In the measurement training, you will...</p>

    <ol start="8">
    <li>...use measurement equipment (sensors, filters, measurement cards, etc.) and corresponding software to interpret experimental data.</li>
    </ol>
    </div>

    <h3 id="modeling">Model development</h3>

    <p>
    Your team is asked to come up with an innovative energy storage and transport initiative, and to deliver an objective assessment of the developed idea. This assessment should not be a sales pitch, but a <em>science-based analysis using a validated model</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <em>development of a mathematical-physical model is central to your project</em>. It is therefore important to clarify the terminology related to modeling. The infographic below defines the most prominent modeling concepts and the relations between them.

    <p>
    Before discussing the <a href="#stages">project stages</a> that will guide you through the model development in detail, let us first address some important questions regarding the role of the model in this project:
    </p>

    <p><b>What is precisely meant with the "model” to be developed?</b></p>

    <p>You will have to develop a mathematical model that describes the essential aspects of your energy storage and transport system. This model will encompass various components, describing various theories of physics. Specifically, you are required to model a time-dependent component of your system through a differential equation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_value_problem">boundary value problem<a>. The complexity of your model will most likely prohibit analytical evaluation and hence a computer model will be needed to evaluate the mathematical-physical model of your system.<p>

    <p><b>What is the purpose of the developed model in this project?</b></p>

    <p>
    As a part of the objective assessment of your idea, the primary performance characteristics of your system (efficiency, storage capacity, etc.) should be quantified. This quantification should be based on a model describing the physical behavior of your system which is relevant in relation to the considered performance indicators. Your assessment should be based on a preliminary design for the system, where the dimensions, material choices, etc. are determined using the model. Without a model it is not possible to form a quantitative objective assessment of your idea!
    </p>

    <p><b>What aspects of the system should be incorporated in the model?</b></p>

    <p>
    What aspects should be included in a model depends on the goal for which it is used. In the case of this project you should provide an objective assessment of the preliminary design of your energy storage and transport system. Therefore all aspects of the system that substantially influence this assessment should be incorporated. Including aspects that are too detailed for the purpose of the model should be avoided, as this unnecessarily increases the complexity of your model. In the development of the model you are expected to consider several options for the model components, and then to select the option that best fits the goal of your model.
    </p>

    <p><b>Is it required to validate the mathematical-physical model and to verify the computer model?</b></p>

    <p>
    Without proper validation and verification (see the infographic for the difference) the results of your model are not trustworthy and hence your assessment will not be meaningful. Building a representative experimental setup of your system will be challenging, but you should pursue to validate as many components of the model as possible. Besides conducting experiments, results reported in the literature can aid in the validation as well.

      Please note the following:
      <ul>
        <li>The rubrics for the Go/No-go pitch, the poster and the technical report will be evaluated purely based on the submitted product. Hence, it is crucial that each of these deliverables goes through a thorough editorial process before submission. Please consider the following tips:
          <ul>
            <li>Have a complete concept version of each deliverable ready multiple days prior to the submission deadline.
            <li>Let all group members review the entire deliverable (not only their own contribution) and let them list their reviewing comments.
            <li>Let each group member score the deliverable based on the available rubric.
            <li>Discuss all reviewing comments and rubric-based self-evaluations with the entire group, and, if there are doubts regarding a rubric item, ask for clarification on the Canvas forum.
            <li>Make agreements on the processing of all comments, and, depending on the required changes, perform an additional second reviewing round.
            <li>Plan for a submission well before the deadline, so that there is time for final modifications if required.
          </ul>
        <li>Make sure to check the Canvas assessment page of the measurement training quiz and practical. Details regarding the purchase of the measurement training toolkit can be found <a href="https://canvas.tue.nl/courses/17759/quizzes/11755">here</a>.

    <h2>Project organization</h2>

    <h3 id="roles">Leadership roles and responsibilities</h3>

    <p>
      There are two leadership roles in this project: a <em>team lead</em> and a team <em>secretary</em>. These roles rotate on a weekly basis. Everybody has to be both team lead and secretary at least once (one week). Other slots can be filled by students working on personal learning goals, or willing to improve their evaluation from the first round.

    <h3 id="meetings">The meetings</h3>

    <p>
  It is required that each student attends all meetings connected to the project, that is: all tutor supervised and self-managed group meetings; all project supporting lectures, training courses, student meetings, etc.
  </p>

    <p>
    Absence is only excused when it concerns an acceptable reason (to be determined by the DBL coordinator). Requests for excused absence have to be submitted in advance to the DBL coordinator. The student will be notified as soon as possible whether the request has been approved.
  </p>

  <p>
  Arriving late to a group meeting is also considered a no-show.

        <sup>1</sup>The goal of the weekly evaluation is to systematically monitor and document the performance of the group and its members in an environment controlled by the tutor. This weekly monitoring instrument is necessary to ensure the quality of the individual assessment procedure and is therefore mandatory. The group should prepare the evaluation prior to the meeting. The meeting is intended for discussing the prepared input, not for filling it out the form from scratch.

        <br>

    <sup>2</sup>In week 4, Part II of the meeting is replaced by a tutor and peer evaluation following the standard ESA procedure. For this evaluation, the agenda of the <a href="#finalmeeting">Individual final assessment meeting with tutor</a> meeting is to be used (condensed to approximately 25 min).

  <h3 id="planning">Project planning and documentation</h3>
  Your group is responsible for developing and maintaining the planning and documentation of your project. The planning and documentation should be stored in your Group's Canvas folder using the following structure:

    <figure>
      <img src="assets/GroupFolder.png" alt="Group folder" style="width:80%">
    </figure>

    The various planning and documentation items are:

  <h4 id="ganttchart">Group's Gantt chart</h4>
  Your group must prepare and maintain a <em>general planning of the project</em>, including key activities, milestones and deliverables. The use of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart">Gantt chart</a> is recommended. Your group is free to select its own template (plenty can be found online). The Gantt chart must be available and up-to-date in your Group's Canvas folder at all times.

  <h4 id="actionitemlist">Group's action list</h4>
  Your group must maintain an <em>action item list</em> following  <a href="assets/Action list template.xlsx">this</a> template.  Note that the pre-listed action items on the template are mandatory for all groups. The action item list should be up-to-date on Canvas at all times.

  <h4 id="actionitemreport">Action item documention</h4>
  <p>
  Each of the action items should be documented in an <em>action item report</em> based on <a href="assets/Action_item_report_template.docx">this</a> template. The reports must be posted in the Group's Canvas folder using the file name convention <em>ItemNr_ShortDescription.docx</em>. All reports must be up-to-date before all group meetings.
  </p>

    <p>
  An action item report documents the work conducted for an action item, and can consist of, for example:
  <ul>
    <li>A literature review
    <li>A mathematical derivation
    <li>Photos of building activities (for the set-up)
    <li>A section of a report
    <li>A video
    <li>A practical description of the work carried out
    <li>...
  </ul>
  </p>

    <h3 id="budget">Experimental setup budget</h3>

    <p> Each 4GB00 group receives a budget of €60 to build an experimental setup to validate (a part of) the developed model. The expenses are paid in advance by the group and will be reimbursed to one of the group members by the end of the project, provided that:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The experimental setup, which is the property of TU/e, is handed in at the final presentation.</li>
          <li>A <em>Bill of Materials (BoM)</em> is included in the report to show how the budget was used. Note that the BoM should also include home materials of substantial value and that the total value on the BoM should not exceed the total budget of €60.</li>
          <li>One student per group submits a signed <em>reclaim form</em> to the 4GB00 organization at the final presentation.</li>
        </ol>

    <h3 id="experimentguidelines">Guidelines regarding the experimental setup</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Follow the <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/about-the-university/security/">safety and security</a> rules of TU/e at all times.</li>
        <li>Save money by avoiding transport fees. Instead, try to purchase your products locally. Think, for example, of the following suppliers:
        </li>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://www.tinytronics.nl/">Tinytronics</a> (Eindhoven)</li>
              <li><a href="https://www.brigatti.nl/">Brigatti electronics</a> (Eindhoven)</li>
              <li><a href="https://www.sossolutions.nl/">SOS solutions</a> (Eindhoven)</li>
              <li><a href="https://www.hornbach.nl/">Hornbach</a> (Best)</li>
            </ul>
        <li>If you do order online, make sure to do so at suppliers in The Netherlands. Experience shows that ordering from abroad will lead problems such as unexpected <em>high import taxes</em> and shipment delays.</li>
            <li>If you decide to purchase batteries, note that:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The <em>use of LiPo batteries is not allowed</em> in this course due to the involved safety risks. Instead purchase NiCD or NiMH batteries</li>
              <li>Some battery systems require expensive external chargers. Take this into consideration in your budget.</li>
              <li>In case of a fire: DO NOT EXTINGUISH WITH WATER! When a battery is thickened or smoking, take it out via the shortest route and cover it with
sand. In case of a fire on campus: call 2222 (= emergency number) and leave the room.
Do not breathe in the smoke or gases! These are very toxic.</li>
      </ul>
