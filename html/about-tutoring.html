	<h1>Welcome to the Energy Storage and Transport (EST) tutor page​</h1>

	<h2  id="role">The role of the tutor</h2>
	<p>As a tutor you play the role of a manager in the R&D department of an oil & gas company. The company's ambition is to transform into a sustainable energy company. In order to ignite this transition, various teams (the student groups) in the company are asked to come up with innovative energy storage and transport initiatives. You are supervising four of such teams. Your main objective is to ensure that the teams understand their responsibilities and operate professionally. It is very important that you do not steer the teams toward a particular solution, as this affects their technical autonomy and may impede innovation.​</p>

	<h2>Tutoring in the Energy Storage and Transport project</h2>
	<p>
		The Energy Storage and Transport project is designed using the concept of <a href="https://www.ru.nl/en/staff/lecturers/designing-education/designing-courses/integrating-learning-objectives">constructive alignment</a>.
		The goal of constructive alignment is to obtain a project in which the learning outcomes (A), the learning process (B), 
		and the assessment (C), are in balance, as to achieve an optimal learning experience.
		As a tutor, especially in the context of challenge-based learning, you can have a strong influence 
		on the learning experience.
		It is therefore important to also align your tutoring style with the project, being aware that different aspects
		of the project require different styles.
		The chart shown below illustrates the intended tutoring style for the various aspects of the course,
		which will be detailed in the remainder of this section.
	</p>

	<h3 id="TutStyles">Tutoring styles</h3>
	<p>
		The table below defines four tutoring styles, ranging from a style in which the tutor is very directive <strong>(I.)</strong>, to a style in which  the students are given
		a lot of freedom <strong>(IV.)</strong>.
	</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>I.</strong></td>
			<td><strong>Directing</strong></td>
			<td>Give direct answers and/or show students how to proceed <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.edurev.2019.02.001">(Van Leeuwen & Janssen, 2019)</a>.</td>	
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>II.</strong></td>
			<td><strong>Steering</strong></td>
			<td>Steer learning activities in the right direction, i.e., toward what is expected/acceptable in the context of the given assignment <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/87567555.1994.9926845">(Grasha, 1994)</a>.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>III.</strong></td>
			<td><strong>Probing</strong></td>
			<td>Ask questions to students such that they need to give more details about their approach toward a given task, without providing your own arguments/opinions (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/87567555.1994.9926845">Grasha, 1994</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1348/000709908X380772">Webb, 2009</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.edurev.2019.02.001">Van Leeuwen & Janssen 2019</a>).</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>IV.</strong></td>
			<td><strong>Coaching</strong></td>
			<td>Act as a supporting coach by asking open-ended questions, providing feedback on the group progress and motivating students to try different ways of solving a problem <a href="http://w.cdio.org/knowledge-library/documents/coaching-practices-challenge-based-learning-characteristics-students’">(Gomez, Doulougeri & Bruns, 2022)</a>.</td>
		</tr>			
	</table>
	<p>
		A particular tutoring style can contain elements of the less directive styles. For example, when steering a group
		in a certain direction <strong>(II.)</strong>, it is often required to probe the group with critical questions <strong>(III.)</strong>.
		The other way around is not possible, however. That is, if you intend to only probe <strong>(III.)</strong> you should not
		steer <strong>(II.)</strong>.
	</p>

	<h3>Project aspects</h3>
	<p>The various aspects in the project, as shown in the chart above, are categorized following the principle of constructive alignment. The description of the aspects below is partially based on CBL experiences at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/03043797.2022.2078181">TU/e</a> and at <a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/cbl/documents/implementing-cbl-for-university-teachers-part-a.pdf">UT/ECIU</a>.
	</p>

	<h4 id="A" >The overarching intended learning objectives (A)</h4>
	<p>This aspect of refers to the overall content and skills that students are expected to have mastered
		by the end of the project.</p>

				In the context of the challenge, the tutor is the direct manager of the group. This creates a mutual responsibility between the tutor and
				the groups to keep each other informed. External stakeholders will be invited to the technical briefings at the end of the project.</td>
