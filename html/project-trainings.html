    <h2 id="trainings">Mandatory trainings</h2>
    <p>To complete this project, you <em>must complete</em> the following trainings:</p>

    <h3 id="infoskillstraining">Information skills training</h3>
    <p>
      In the compulsory <a class="infoskills">Finding and processing of (scientific) information</a> training, you will get acquainted with scientific databases and you will learn how to create an efficient search process by formulating effective search queries in which relevant and alternative search terms are combined by using operators. Once you have found results, you will learn how to evaluate whether those results are relevant to your research. You will also understand what it means to conduct research with 'scientific integrity'.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a blended training for which you will have to <em>attend an on-campus training and complete online modules and assignments</em>. The assignments will be carried out by your project group. Instructions about the assignments will be provided during the on-campus training. The course will be graded as "good/pass/fail" and it is <em>required to obtain at least a "pass" for this professional skill to complete 4CBLA30</em>. In case of an unsatisfactory grade (a fail), the training needs to be re-taken.
    </p>

    <p>
      N.B.: Attendance of this training is mandatory. Bring a fully charged laptop and earphones to the live session!<br>
      N.B.: For details about this training, see the <a class="infoskills">Information Skills Canvas page</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="sosatraining">Social safety training</h3>
    <p>
      In the <em>Social Safety and Inclusive Collaboration</em> training you will be introduced to the topic of social safety in education. This <em>compulsory session</em> will be organized in the form of a theatre play by the <a href="https://www.timeoutcafe.nu/">TIME OUT Foundation</a>, called SAFE SPACE. The play is especially designed for students at their request. The play will cover the topic of transgressive behavior, sexual intimidation and power abuse. When do we call something transgressive? Who decides on that? And where do we encounter such behavior?
    </p>
      
    <p>
      N.B.: Attendance of this training is mandatory. Please bring your campus card for identification.
    </p>

    <h3 id="measurementtraining">Measurement training</h3>
    <p>
      This training focuses on the application of hardware and software during experiments. Students can complete the <a class="practical">mandatory practical part</a> of this training during the scheduled hours in the PROTO/zone Hallway, where practical equipment is available. The <a class="measurementtheory">theory assignment</a> part of the training can be completed online. Detailed instructions and due dates are available on the Canvas page (<a class="practical">practical</a>, <a class="measurementtheory">theory assignment</a>).
