    <h3 id="infoskillstraining">Information skills training</h3>
    <p>
      In the compulsory <a class="infoskills">Finding and processing of (scientific) information</a> training, you will get acquainted with scientific databases and you will learn how to create an efficient search process by formulating effective search queries in which relevant and alternative search terms are combined by using operators. Once you have found results, you will learn how to evaluate whether those results are relevant to your research. You will also understand what it means to conduct research with 'scientific integrity'.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a blended training for which you will have to <em>attend an on-campus training and complete online modules and assignments</em>. The assignments will be carried out by your project group. Instructions about the assignments will be provided during the on-campus training. The course will be graded as "good/pass/fail" and it is <em>required to obtain at least a "pass" for this professional skill to complete 4CBLA30</em>. In case of an unsatisfactory grade (a fail), the training needs to be re-taken.
