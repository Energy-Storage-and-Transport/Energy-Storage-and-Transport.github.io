		<i class="fa-solid fa-calendar-days"></i> Mandatory trainings
	</h1>

    <p>To complete this project, you <em>must complete</em> the following trainings:</p>

    <h2 id="infoskillstraining">Information skills training</h2>
    <p>
      In the compulsory <a class="infoskills">Finding and processing of (scientific) information</a> training, you will get acquainted with scientific databases and you will learn how to create an efficient search process by formulating effective search queries in which relevant and alternative search terms are combined by using operators. Once you have found results, you will learn how to evaluate whether those results are relevant to your research. You will also understand what it means to conduct research with 'scientific integrity'. For details about this training, see the <a class="infoskills">Information Skills Canvas page</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="measurementtraining">Individual measurement and modeling assignment</h2>
    <p>
      Understanding the modeling cycle - including experimental validation - is an important part of the project. In this individual training, you will learn how to perform measurements and how to analyze the data you obtain. You will also learn how to use the available measurement equipment. This training consists of two parts:
      <ul>
        <li><a class="practical">Practical session:</a> During this <a href="html/studyguide-schedule.html">scheduled practical session</a> you will work with the available equipment to execute Arduino-based practical assignments. You will also <em>collect experimental data</em> for the take-home assignment.</li>
        <li><a class="measurementtheory">Take-home assignment</a>: Using the data gathered in the practical session, you will work on an individual take-home assignment. This assignment trains your <em>understanding of the modeling cycle</em>, including a training on how to use Simulink.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
