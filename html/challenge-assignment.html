	<h2>The challenge</h2>
    <p>Energy Storage and Transport is a challenge-based learning (CBL) project, set in the context of the energy transition:</p>

	<div class="block">Your team is working in the R&D department of an oil & gas company. The company's ambition is to transform into a sustainable energy company. In order to ignite this transition, various teams in the company, including yours, are asked to come up with <em>innovative energy storage and transport initiatives</em>. In 8 weeks time, you are asked to deliver an objective assessment of the developed idea. The company representatives are not interested in listening to sales pitches, but instead want a <em>science-based analysis based on a validated model</em>.</div>
		 
	<h2>Project goal</h2>
    <p>The overarching goal of this project is defined as:</p>
    
      <div class="block">
       To develop a <em>mathematical-physical model</em> for an energy storage and transport system, and to validate this model using experiments. Within the framework of challenge-based learning, the project groups independently define their own energy storage and transport solution.
	  </div>
    
	  <p>In the process of accomplishing this overarching objective, the following learning goals will be achieved:</p>
	  <ol>
		<li> ...define an energy transport and storage system with time-dependent behavior. The complexity of the system should be in line with the competence level expected from a first year engineering student, and should take into account the strengths and weaknesses of your project group.</li>
		<li>...apply a predefined modeling cycle when developing and validating a model. In the early stages of the project, your group should be able to identify the key components and possible bottlenecks in the various modeling phases and to establish a time line for the modeling process.</li>
		<li>
		...apply known mathematical-physical concepts to model the time-dependent behavior of the selected system. Your group should be able to identify key components of the system and describe at least one of these components by a differential equation.</li>
		<li>...reflect on the validity of the model, and to develop a plan to experimentally validate a crucial, time-dependent, component of the system.</li>
		<li>...design and build an experimental set-up, in order to validate the identified critical, time-dependent, component of the system. In designing the experiment, your group should focus on reproducibility and accuracy.</li>
		<li>...perform experiments and process and analyze experimental data following good statistical practice. Your group should be able to draw conclusions regarding the validity of the model, and to propose model and experiment improvements based on the processed data.</li>
		<li>...draw conclusions and make recommendations regarding the applicability and economic viability of the considered energy transport and storage system in the real-world setting, making use of the validated model.
		</li>
	  </ol>
  
	  <p>To train you for performing the experimental validation, as part of this project, a measurement training is provided. In the measurement training, you will...</p>
  
	  <ol start="8">
	  <li>...use measurement equipment (sensors, filters, measurement cards, etc.) and corresponding software to interpret experimental data.</li>
	  </ol>
