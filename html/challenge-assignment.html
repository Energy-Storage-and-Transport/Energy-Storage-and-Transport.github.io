    <p>
      Energy Storage and Transport is a challenge-based learning (CBL) project, set in the context of the energy transition:
    </p>

	<h3>Challenge</h3>
		<p>
		  Your team is working in the R&D department of an oil & gas company. The company's ambition is to transform into a sustainable energy company. In order to ignite this transition, various teams in the company, including yours, are asked to come up with <em>innovative energy storage and transport initiatives</em>. In 8 weeks time, you are asked to deliver an objective assessment of the developed idea. The company representatives are not interested in listening to sales pitches, but instead want a <em>science-based analysis based on a validated model</em>. 
		</p>

	<h3 id="projectgoals">Project goals</h3>
    <p>The overarching goal of this project is defined as:</p>
    
	<h3>Project goal</h3>
      <p>
       To develop a mathematical-physical model for an energy storage and transport system, and to validate this model using experiments. Within the framework of challenge-based learning, the project groups independently define their own energy storage and transport solution.
