	</h1>

  <h2 id="teammeeting">Lab meetings with coach</h3>    
  <p>
    The team meetings in the lab are the moment to work together on your project as a team and to consult your teacher coach for advise. The team meetings are also the moment to work on your setup and to conduct the measurements. During the team meeting, your teacher coach will visit your group to provide feedback on the deliverables.
  </p>

  <h2 id="tutormeetings">Tutor meetings</h3>
    
  <p> 
    The tutor meeting is the place to discuss the organization of your project. As part of this discussion, your team discusses the progress on open action points, the planning (and possible adjustments thereof), the definition of new action points, the distribution of tasks, <i>etc.</i> In this discussion there should also be attention for individual learning goals. A standard agenda for these meetings is provided below:
  </p>

  <p>
    Your tutor will systematically monitor and document the performance of the group and its members (the role of the tutor is detailed <a href="html/about-tutoring.html">here</a>). It is the joint responsibility of the tutor and the team to ensure that the tutor is well informed. In week 5, one of the tutor meetings will be dedicated to the midterm evaluation. The final assessment meeting is also completely dedicated to the evaluation.
