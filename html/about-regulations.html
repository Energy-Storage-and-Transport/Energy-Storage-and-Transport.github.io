    <i class="fa-solid fa-gavel"></i> Regulations
  </h1>

  <h2 id="attendance">Attendance rules</h2>
  <p>
    In CBL all group members are equally responsible for the project outcome. Therefore, it is required that each student attends all meetings connected to the project, i.e.:
    <ul>
      <li>all group meetings;</li>
      <li>all project-supporting lectures, training courses, building sessions, student meetings, etc.</li>       
    </ul>
    Attendance is registered by the tutor. All absence is considered invalid, unless it concerns personal circumstances (PER art. 8.7), to be confirmed by the Academic Advisor.
  </p>

  <p>
    To register valid absences, students must contact the Academic Advisors via <a class="contact">email</a>, within 24 hours. Note your name, student number, course code, group number, reason for absence and date of absence. The Academic Advisor informs the student and CBL coordinator in case personal circumstances were confirmed.  
  </p>

  <p>
    More than 1 invalid or 2 absences in total, means a FAIL for the course. Students need to inform their group and tutor of absence. Arriving late to a group meeting or online attendance is also considered a no show. If the student is unable to join in person, they can attend through Teams, but this does not count as attendance.
  </p>

  <h2 id="submissions">Deliverable submission rules</h2>
  <p>
    For all deliverable submissions, the following applies:
    <ul>
      <li><em>Submitting a deliverable is a group responsibility.</em> This includes reviewing a deliverable together and checking whether it is submitted properly.</li>
      <li>Deliverables must be submitted by the indicated due date on Canvas. For late submissions, the following applies:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Time late</th>
            <th>Deductions</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>0 to 1 hour</td>
            <td>10% of maximum assignment points</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>1 to 3 hours</td>
            <td>25% of maximum assignment points</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>3 to 6 hours</td>
            <td>50% of maximum assignment points</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>More than 6 hours</td>
            <td>Assignment will not be graded.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </li>
      <li>The rubrics for the Go/No-go pitch, the poster, the standard operating procedure and the technical report will be evaluated purely based on the submitted product.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2 id="protozone">Lab work</h2>
  <p>
    You can work in the lab during the hours scheduled for your group. Before entering the lab, please read the <a href="assets/safetydoc.jpg">safety rules</a>. If you don't follow the safety rules, the staff will (kindly) oblige you to leave. At the end of a session, you must tidy up your own workbench and bring back the tools you borrowed. When you leave without tidying up, you'll get a warning. After 2 warnings the staff will (kindly) oblige you to leave the lab.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every group gets an <em>experimental toolbox</em> in which all components are stored in between meetings. At the end of the final lab session you must hand in your toolbox in the same condition as you received it. The available components cannot be modified irreversibly. If a component malfunctions, please report this to the teachers. Lost or intentionally damaged components will be charged.
  </p>

  <h2 id="referencing">Use of internet tools and referencing</h2>
  <p>
    Internet tools can broadly be divided in Large Language Models (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, etc.) and Information tools (search engines, online databases, etc.). Such tools may provide a wealth of information to enhance design and/or research activities, especially in exploration and comparative phases. Therefore, you are encouraged to use these internet tools to enhance your learning process. However, such tools should never be used to generate content (text, source code or images) and it should be unambiguously clear to what extent such tools aided in the conception of new ideas. Moreover, you should always be critical about the quality of your information sources and make sure to properly reference them. 
  </p>

  <p>
    To address concerns regarding potential misuse of internet tools. It is essential that you adhere to the following guidelines<sup>1</sup>:
    <ol>
      <li> Provide precise references for the parts of your work where internet tools are used.
      <li> Provide an explanation for why you opted to use specific tools and evaluate their usefulness.
      <li> Do not use Large Language Models to generate report text, source code or images.
    </ol>
    It is important to adhere to these guidelines to maintain academic integrity and to avoid potential plagiarism issues, just as any other unreferenced use of external source material.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Examples</em> for proper use of external source material are given below. When in doubt, always contact the responsible lecturer or project coach for consultation: 
    <ol>
      <li> Compulsory when using Large Language Models
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>ChatGPT was used to optimize a Matlab script:</i>
            In the main text of your report clearly indicate when and how you used ChatGPT for this purpose, for example: “The Matlab script has been optimized using ChatGPT as explained in Appendix #”. In the appendix you should then explain the prompts used to obtain the optimized code.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>ChatGPT was used to improve the writing style of the introduction:</i> 
            Clearly indicate which sections were improved using ChatGPT. This may be done by adding a footnote: “The text in the introduction has been improved using ChatGPT using the prompt: “Hi ChatGPT, I have written this paragraph: [included in Appendix #], can you please make it more formal?””. This means that the original text must be included in the appendix, where also a reflection on the usefulness of the ChatGPT-based improvement should be provided. 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Compulsory when using internet sources
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can use common referencing methods or footnotes for the use of internet sources and information encyclopedia tools (e.g., Wikipedia), for example through their URL. However, since these tools are volatile, always indicate the date on which you consulted them. This volatility also indicates the added value of trying to find references in books and/or academic journals instead.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Recommended when using information tools to explore internet databases
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Bing was used to explore benchmarks:</i> In the relevant part of the report, add a footnote indicating its usage: “This benchmark analysis was performed using “Bing” with keywords “keyword 1, keyword2, etc.”, after which the first 20 results were selected for further analysis.”. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Google scholar was used to find articles to be included in a literature survey:</i> Indicate the usage of the tool In the report: “For this literature survey “Google scholar” was used with keywords “keyword 1, keyword 2, etc.“, after which the 15 most cited papers were selected”.  
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

      <sup>1</sup> These guidelines have been carefully formulated with all the necessary information. Should differences occur between these guidelines and the rules and regulations as given in the Program and Examination Regulations (PER) and/or the Examination Regulations (ER), the PER/ER are always leading.
