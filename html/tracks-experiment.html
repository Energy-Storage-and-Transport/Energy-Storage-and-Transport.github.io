	<h2>Objectives</h2>
		<ul>
			<li> To <em>select a physical law related to your EST model for experimental validation</em> and to reflect on its role in the overall testing and validation procedure for your EST system.
			<li> To <em>develop an experimental setup and experimentation plan</em> capable of validating the selected physical law.
			<li> To <em>conduct the validation experiments</em>, process their results, and reflect on the validity of the selected physical law.

	<h2>Description</h2>
	<!--The validation/testing pyramid and selecting a physical phenomenon/law-->
	<p>
		Testing a complex system - such as your real-world EST system - and validating a model for it is a challenging endeavor, especially when that system still needs to be developed. Simply building the complete system for testing is not possible until its detailed design is complete. That is, only in the phase just before taking such a system in production, performing full scale tests is possible. And even then the number of tests that can be done is limited because of the costs involved. So, if you cannot test the full system during the development process, how do you test your system and how do you validate your model? Instead of testing the system in full, you can perform a <em>testing and validation procedure composed of a large number of smaller scale tests</em>, which together form a <em>testing or validation pyramid</em>: 
	</p>

	</figure>

	<p>
		<em>In the development process of a complex system you will build the testing and validation pyramid from the bottom up.</em> The higher you get in the pyramid, the closer you get to testing the system in full. In fact, the full-scale test is at the top of the pyramid. At this level of testing, the width of the pyramid is very narrow, indicating that only a limited number of tests is performed. The level below the full-scale tests considers the subsystems and the level below that the components of the subsystems. As you descend, the pyramid broadens and the number of tests increases. As you approach the bottom of the pyramid, you will consider a large number of tests for parts, physical processes, materials, etc. These tests are in general not specific to the full-scale system, but do play an important role in forming the basis of the pyramid, and are therefore essential in the overall validation procedure. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Clearly, building the complete testing and validation pyramid for your EST system is not possible in eight weeks. But that does not mean that you cannot contribute to the validation process. <em>Your group will select one of the physical laws used in your model for experimental validation.</em> The selected physical law should be as relevant as possible in view of the overall validation procedure. You should be able to explain its position in the validation pyramid and it should be clear what aspect(s) of the EST system (model) can be validated by the experiment. In the choice of your validation experiment, you should consider whether the required setup can be constructed using one of the <a href="html/studyguide-data.html#toolboxinventory">experimental toolboxes</a>:

	<!--To develop a standard operating procedure-->
	<p>
		Throughout the project you will <em>develop the experimental setup</em> for you validation experiment, along with a <em>standard operating procedure (SOP)</em> which describes the setup and all the steps in the experimental procedure. While developing the validation experiment, it is important to carefully consider which type of measurement results are needed to successfully validate the selected physical. Using the components in the toolbox of your choice, your team is free in designing its own experiment.
	</p>

	<p>
		An essential part of the design of your setup is the <em>integration of sensors</em> that automatically <em>gather data using an Arduino</em>. To get you acquainted with the use of sensors and Arduino-based data gathering, early in the project you will participate in a <a class="practical">measurement practical</a> with an accompanying <a class="measurementtheory">take-home modeling assignment</a>. For the sensors in your validation experiment you need to study how they should be wired electronically. You should also develop the Arduino code to gather the data and, if applicable, you should develop calibration procedures.
	</p>

	<!--To conduct the experiments and asses the validity-->
	<p>
		Using the developed setup, you will <em>perform the validation experiments</em>. Your validation experiment should be documented in a measurement plan (part of the SOP), in which the experimental steps are described in detail. Based on the measurement plan, someone else should be able to reproduce the results. To attain statistically meaningful experimental results, your group should execute the experiment multiple times, strictly following the measurement plan. You should also create post-processing scripts which convert the raw data of all experiments into interpretable output, for example in the form of graphs. In these results, the uncertainties in the measurements should be visualized, for example using error bars. Once you have collected the output of the experiments, you can assess the validity of the considered physical law. The best way to do this is by plotting the experimental results and theoretical results in one graph. This makes it straightforward to <em>observe and interpret the differences and similarities between the model result and the experimental data</em>.
