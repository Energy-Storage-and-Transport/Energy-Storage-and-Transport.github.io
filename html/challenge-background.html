    <p>
    Realizing a more <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">sustainable future</a> with affordable and clean energy is one of the biggest societal challenges we face today. The process of making our energy system sustainable is referred to as the <em>energy transition</em>. Technological innovations across a wide range of disciplines are required to realize this transition.
    </p>

    <p>
    The energy transition poses tremendous challenges for engineers, both from a technological perspective and from the vantage point of sustainability. As an engineer of the future, you will likely be developing technology that contributes to the energy transition. While you do this, you are expected to take into consideration the effects that this technology has on our lives.
    </p>

    <p>
    A major technological challenge in the energy transition is to accommodate our energy system to deal with the more <em>fluctuating nature of green energy sources</em> compared to conventional (fossil fuel based) energy sources. Where conventional energy production can be controlled reliably, renewable energy production depends on external factors over which we have limited control. In the current energy system, where a substantial part of the energy still comes from fossil fuels, the fluctuations in renewable energy production are leveled out by conventional energy production. With the share of renewable energy production increasing substantially in the years to come, the development of technology to deal with its fluctuations is necessary.

    <p>
    In the western world, energy exchange markets (for example <a href="https://www.epexspot.com/">EPEX SPOT</a> in the Netherlands) regulate the supply and demand of energy. To improve the competitiveness of green energy production, it is essential to make them less dependent on balancing by conventional energy sources. The ability to efficiently store green energy in situations when there is a surplus of production (for example, at night) and to deliver this stored energy when there is a surplus of demand (for example, during the day), is key to reducing the need for balancing. Currently, the storage capacity on the energy grid is limited, especially in countries without natural hydroelectric dams (such as the Netherlands). The development of <em>innovative energy storage and transport technologies</em> is essential to make green energy competitive, and, thereby, to enable the energy transition.
